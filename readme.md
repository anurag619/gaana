## specification ##

tired of not getting a decent song to hear on Gaana.com/saavn.com {I am using gaana.com here}. This app will give you the leverage of experiencing songs of your taste just with the click of a bottom.


* [gaana](http://gaana.com) recently launched their [API](http://developer.gaana.com). The present idea is to use the api to serve music options to users where they would get songs of their taste lined up in the playlist. You can get more information about the basic functionality in [music-ls](https://github.com/anurag619/music-ls).

* to get a taste of things, run the above project locally and observe whats happening. The html and css is bit messy, we can revert it when the overall functionally get complete.
* the basic idea is to create a music app.

wanna contribute ?

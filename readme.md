## specification ##

tired of not getting a decent song to hear on Gaana.com/saavn.com {I am using gaana.com here}. This app will give you the leverage of experiencing songs of your taste just with the click of a bottom.


 

* [gaana](http://gaana.com) recently launched their [API](http://developer.gaana.com). The present idea is to use the api to serve music options to users where they would get songs of their taste lined up in the playlist. You can get more information about the basic functionality in [music-ls](https://github.com/anurag619/music-ls).
